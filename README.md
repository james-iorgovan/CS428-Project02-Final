Project 2 (The Life-size Humanoid)
***Disclaimer: Because the apk file is too large, it will not be within this GitHub repo. I will take you through how to open it up.

Go to File > Build Settings > Platform > Android/iOS
Select to build only the SecondScene
Select Build
After this, you will get an apk if you are using Android or an ipo if you are using an iPhone (also, make not that your Unity engine must be iOS compatable which you can do by applying the module under your Installations).
After this, connect you phone to the laptop and unlock your phone. You will get a folder with your phone storage.
Find your downloads folder and drag and drop the apk/ipo file into there.
Disconnect the phone and go to you downloads folder. When selecting to open the file, you will get a message.
Select install.
Point your phone's camera near the ground (at first you might need to get close to the ground until you see a focus box appear).
The life-size humanoid will then appear. You can see it typing and it will not move even if you walk around it.
